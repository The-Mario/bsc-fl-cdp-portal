# MakerDAO Testchain

This tool will help you set up a local testchain and deploy the contracts you need to work with Maker apps.

This branch, `dai.js`, is configured with the contracts needed for the [Dai.js](https://github.com/makerdao/dai.js) library.

## Installation and requirements

Requires [Seth](https://dapp.tools/seth/), [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix), Node.js and Bash.

Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install Ganache.

## Typical usage

```
scripts/launch -s default --fast
```

## Usage

Run `scripts/launch`.

If run with no arguments, it will start Ganache at `127.0.0.1:2000` with the chain data it finds in `var/chaindata`, and run until killed with Ctrl-C.

If `var/chaindata` does not exist, and the `--reset-chaindata` argument is not present, the `default` snapshot will be used to create it.

Once the deployment is complete, you will find the list of contract addresses in the `out/addresses.json` file.

## Deployer account

Some governance processes are bypassed in the testchain deployment, which gives the account that deployed everything some special priveleges within the system (such as triggering a shutdown). It also starts with a balance of 400 MKR.

## Creating a new snapshot

If you want to add new contracts to the deployment scripts and create a new snapshot from the resulting deployment, you can run the following series of commands:

```
scripts/launch --reset-chaindata -d --deploy-scd-only -u
scripts/create-snapshot scd-only --force
scripts/launch -s scd-only -d --deploy-mcd-only -u
scripts/create-snapshot default --force
```

The above series creates a separate snapshot with only the scd deployment simply to make updating mcd-specific code easier and faster. If this isn't relevant to your use case, you can omit those steps and run:

```
scripts/launch --reset-chaindata -d -u
scripts/create-snapshot your-snapshot-name
```

Snapshot names are arbitrary, so in the above case, you could create another snapshot if necessary. The `--force` flag in the first example is only required if you're overwriting an existing snapshot.

Also note that `-u` skips the submodule update, and can be omitted if you need to update before running the scripts.

If you run the scd and mcd scripts separately, be careful to only include `--reset-chaindata` in the former. The mcd scripts depend on some of the chaindata from the scd scripts, and will fail without it. If you're running them both at the same time, like in the second example above, you can include it without causing any failures.

### Options

* `-s, --snapshot`: Optional. This should match the name of a folder under the `snapshots` folder. This will be copied to `var/chaindata`, overwriting anything there.

* `-d, --deploy`: Optional. If set, `scripts/deploy` will be run once Ganache is set up, to deploy contracts to the test chain.

* `--fast`: Skip `git submodule update` and skip running `dapp build` for dapps that are already built. This is accomplished by setting the `SKIP_BUILD_IF_ALREADY_BUILT` environment variable, so the dapp build scripts must be written (or modified; see the use of `sed_inplace` in `scripts/deploy`) to support it.

* `--reset-chaindata`: Start the testchain with no data.

* `-u, --skip-update`: Skip the git submodule updates, but still run `dapp build` on the contracts.

* `-p, --port`: Start Ganache on a different port.

* `--throw-revert`: Have Ganache throw an exception whenever a transaction is reverted.

* `--ci`: If this is set, all unrecognized arguments will be treated as a new command. This command will be run, and Ganache will exit afterward.

## Deploying changes to contract code

When the deploy script is run, it copies ABI files and output addresses of deployment contracts to a file in `out/` directory. These can be copied into the source code of applications working with the test chain as you see fit.

## Creating new snapshots

Use `scripts/create-snapshot NAME` to copy the contents of `var/chaindata` into a new folder `snapshots/NAME`. Add `--force` if you want to replace an existing snapshot.

## Recipe: rebuilding MCD

```
./scripts/launch -s scd-only --deploy --deploy-mcd-only
```

This starts with a snapshot of all the SCD contracts, and then redeploys all the MCD contracts on top of that snapshot. Edit `scripts/deploy-mcd` to tweak the build parameters or add to it.
