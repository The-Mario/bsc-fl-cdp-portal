      answer3:
        "With Market, when you create an order you are placing an order in the order book. In order for your order to be matched, you need another user to 'Take' your order by either buying or selling at a price that includes your open order. Instant allows you to quickly trade one token for another at the best price available on the order book. This means you can see the price you will pay for the token and once your transaction confirms, you will get the token (the price may move slightly due to slippage).",
      question4:
        'What is slippage and is there a limit to how much the price can change?',
      answer4:
        "Slippage is where the price you think you are getting changes between the point you place your order and the time the transaction is processed. For example, you place an order to buy 1 ETH for 200 USDFL, but by the time the transaction has confirmed, the price is now 202 USDFL per ETH. This means you would get 0.99 ETH for 200 USDFL instead. Within Freeliquid Trade you can set your slippage limit by a percentage, which means once your order is being matched, if it can't meet the price +/- slippage limit, then the order will automatically cancel. ",
      question5:
        'Does Freeliquid or anyone at Freeliquid have any access to my crypto or my wallet?',
      answer5:
        'No, Freeliquid Trade is a fully non-custodial, decentralised exchange. This means that you are in full control of your funds at all times, and only you can place orders or move your funds around. All orders are placed and settled directly in the smart contract, and everything is fully audit-able on-chain at all times.',
